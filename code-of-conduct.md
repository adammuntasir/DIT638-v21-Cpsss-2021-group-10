#How do we plan to collaborate?
We first discuss the assignments as a group and decide on tasks that need to be done in one development period. 
We then allow team members to choose the tasks that they feel comfortable with, making sure an equal amount of work is assigned to each member. 
 
#How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
We will have a retrospective meeting before or after submitting each assignment in which each member discusses his task with other group members and answers their questions.
We use Discord so that all communication within the team is saved into the Discord group and can be referred to when needed. 
We will use either Discord or Google Meet for video chat.
All communication between group members will be done using one forum so that everyone is informed about all decisions all the time. (No private messages will be used to discuss group matters) 
 
#How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
Notes can be shared among team members when someone needs further clarifications before contacting the TA or the teacher. 
Any useful resources found on the internet can be distributed to all group members using Discord. 
 
#What is our usual communication plan?
We plan to meet twice a week preferably on Mondays and Fridays. Also if the team feels the need to have an extra meeting, it can be arranged. 
If someone is not able to attend a group meeting, they should inform the team beforehand. 
 
#How will we solve conflicts? 
We will discuss disagreements in group meetings and try to reason for or against a decision to come to a conclusion. If not agreed, we can vote to a decision. In case of further conflict, we will consult a TA for further advice.
