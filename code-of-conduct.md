## **How do we plan to collaborate?**
- We first discuss the assignments as a group and decide on tasks that need to be done in one development period. 
- We then allow team members to choose the tasks that they feel comfortable with, making sure an equal amount of work is assigned to each member. 
 
## **How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?**
- We will have a retrospective meeting before or after submitting each assignment in which each member discusses his task with other group members and answers their questions.
- We use Discord so that all communication within the team is saved into the Discord group and can be referred to when needed. 
We will use either Discord or Google Meet for video chat.
- All communication between group members will be done using one forum so that everyone is informed about all decisions all the time. (No private messages will be used to discuss group matters) 
 
## **How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?**
- Notes can be shared among team members when someone needs further clarifications before contacting the TA or the teacher. 
- Any useful resources found on the internet can be distributed to all group members using Discord. 
 
## **What is our usual communication plan?**
- We plan to meet twice a week preferably on Mondays and Fridays. Also if the team feels the need to have an extra meeting, it can be arranged. 
- If someone is not able to attend a group meeting, they should inform the team beforehand. 
 
## **How will we solve conflicts?** 
All conflicts can be dealt with by adding suggestions instead of direct criticism. 
Discussions start out by pointing to the positive points of the issue before heading to the conflict itself. 
1. To reduce the probability of ending up in conflicts we can take preventative measures such as:
    1. Discussing and task assigning will happen during the team meeting for each assignment. During the meeting each team member  will choose the task that he feels he could accomplish. 
2. If the conflict is between two members we will encourage them to have this discussion privately before taking it to the group meeting as a lot of conflict happens due to miss understanding or lack of resources or knowledge gap. If not solved we will move to the next step.
3. If any conflict arises due to different opinions or task assigning or even complaints about project progress or a team member not contributing we will move to the next step.
    1. Further discussion will take place during this step. We will answer the following questions to have a deeper understanding of the issues: 
        1. what is the conflict
        2. why did the conflict happen
        3. how to solve it
    2. We will discuss disagreements in group meetings and try to reason for or against a decision to come to a conclusion. If not agreed, we can vote to a decision. In case of further conflict, we will consult a TA for further advice.
    3. We can deal with less obvious conflicts through increasing communication between team members; 
        1. if the conflict arise during pair programming then both should resolve it through directly discussing it while referring to either the course lectures or internet material
        2. In case the pair are still not 100% sure that the conflict is solved then they can post questions in Discord in order get everyone's input
